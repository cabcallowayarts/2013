Before we head off into the wonderful world of styles, there if one more important concept to learn that is crucial to websites, and that is the box model. When a browser displays a webpage, everything can be separated into boxes. This is because every element on the page is interpreted as a box, no matter what shape it is seem as. This is one of the limitations of web design, but it is also very useful in most situations. However, to take advantage of it, you must know how it works.

There are four parts of the box-model, and I will list them from the inside out. First off, we have the <b>content</b>, which is in the very middle. This is what you put in between the opening and closing tags. As you move out from that, you have the <b>padding</b>, which separates the content from it's border, to give it a little breathing room. Speaking of that, the next part of the box model is the <b>border</b>, which is seen as the limit of the element. The background color only extends to this limit, and it is generally seen as the whole extent of the element. However, there is one more part, and that is <b>margin</b>. The margin is the outside of the element, and is what separates one element from other elements. Without it, all elements would be right next to each other, and it would be hard to look at a webpage. Now that you have learned this, you are ready to start learning the various styles that you can apply to your websites.
