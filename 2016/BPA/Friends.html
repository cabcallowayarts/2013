        <p>Driving with Friends can be fun, but it can also be very dangerous. Having passengers in the car, especially loud ones, can be very distracting and can cause you to not focus on the road by paying attention to them instead. Teens, young children, pets and even adults can be very distracting while you're driving. They might talk too much or do things that get the driver's attention.

	Research says that Teens tend to try and be responsible and drive safely on the road and when in crashes, teens said it was the objects inside the car that got them distracted. With adults, men get more distracted with passengers in the car than women did. 71% of males and 48% of women got distracted by passengers while in testing. Testing also says that most of the men drove more aggressively with passengers than females.
	Teens are known to get into car crashes, especially with passengers in the car. In fact, there are laws to limit the number of passengers in a car, although, Car crashes are still the number one cause of death of teens in the U.S. and are four more times likely to be involved in a fatal crash than most adults. Although most teens are under rules and enforcements by their parents or guardians, that help them stay safe on the road.</p>
