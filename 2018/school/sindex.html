Students are required to take a set amount of science credits, and then are allowed to extend their knowledge though AP classes. Cab students can also take classes at Charter School of Wilmington, which shares a building with Cab. Charter offers many more advanced science classes, such as Astronomy or Nanotechnology.
Cab Calloway's Science Olympiad team is one of the top-ranking teams in the state. The Cab Calloway Math League team meets around once a week throughout the year, and participate in four meets, generally sending many people to states. Cab Calloway has had a lot of success over the past few years with Odyssey of the Mind. Many teams have ended up going to the world competition. These teams are formed by individuals, and then consult with a few teachers in order to get registered.
