            <p class="contentp">Artificial intelligence, like most technologies, can advance research in many fields and do more than just a short list of tasks. However, no matter how A.I is applied in research, the procedure and benefits are clear. A.I can observe patterns and spot differences and track data, including trends and outliers and even have responses to carry out tasks depending on what the data reads. This is very general and can be applied almost anywhere. A good example of this is at the Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). There’s a project at this university that is using A.I technology to develop personalized cancer treatments. The A.I scans patients and can identify tumors. From there it examines the tumor and categorizes and then gathers as much information on the tumor that it can gather. The extensive information it can gather can help doctors make a better and more personalized treatment for patients. The kind of A.I capability to do in-depth information gathering and analyzing can be applied to advance almost any field of research, because it’s so versatile. </p>

            <h2>Available Technologies</h2>
            <p class="contentp">
            Current A.I, with its data-handling prowess, is a very useful tool in research. Sifting through complicated ideas and identifying trends has been a boon for researchers, and the development of new technologies has no doubt been accelerated through use of machine learning. </p>
            <p class="contentp">An incredible ability of A.I that has been demonstrated is the ability to make predictions about disease and mental health based on information that no doctor would have been able to see through. Methods like this can accelerate diagnoses by months to years, and demonstrate the effectiveness of A.I in detecting subtle patterns.
            <br>
            Medicine, economics, psychology, and many other areas of research could face a revolution in progress through use of current robotic tech. A.I can already help to navigate and map the seafloor, bring knowledge to help fight disease, and bring a greater understanding of the human mind, and these are just the already proven subjects for the technology. Much of what is needed to bring automation to the development of human knowledge is present in the potential of machine learning, it just hasn’t been applied yet.
            </p>
            <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
            <p class="contentp">One huge concern for people developing neural networks is that once the robot has been through the data and can perform its task well, no one can actually tell how or why an A.I makes the choices that it does. This was especially hurtful where A.I was able to make incredibly early predictions about whether someone had cancer or not. While those diagnosed were faced with a better chance of survival, knowing what the network had detected to make its prediction is potentially more beneficial, and would allow doctors to work without the need for the technology.</p>
            <h2>Future Uses</h2>
            <p class="contentp">In the future, a robot or computer may be able to act as an independent researcher, without the need for human input. The ability of A.I to critically think at this point has been shown to be lackluster, with robots still basically only being able to accomplish what we want them to and needing to be handmade for a variety of different situations. However, as A.I continues to grow in complexity and effective intelligence, its versatility will continue to expand as an excellent tool for research. While a robot of the caliber necessary to facilitate research independently would have to be near to humans in intelligence, it doesn’t necessarily need the emotional intelligence of a human to accomplish this. A human could still do the work of communicating what the robot has discovered, but A.I could still be years away from having emotions and have this still be a viable option.</p>
