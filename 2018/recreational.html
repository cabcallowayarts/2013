            <p class="contentp">The recreational uses of artificial intelligence are somewhat more limited than other areas, but still viable. The technology of machine learning allows A.I to do multiple things that could benefit or be a part of a community. One example of this is a machine guide. A.I can use machine learning to become familiar with an area, and guide people to wherever they need to go, or going down the same thought it could be a tour guide. This is shown in IBM’s tour robot “Watson” that uses data from a person’s phone to where they are and where they’re looking to guide them around an art museum. Another recreational use of A.I is the use of chatbots to help people. While other things mentioned with chatbot type programs were more meant for personal usage, they also can be programmed for more communal benefit. This can be seen at sporting events, where companies have set up chat bots to give you more in depth game stats, or to do things like guide you to a place to eat depending on what you want and where you parked. The versatility of A.I alone can allow for potential anywhere, but limited development has so far been involved in recreation.</p>
            <div id="fillimage"><img class="contentimg" src="recreational2.jpg"></div>
            <h2>Available Technologies</h2>
            <p class="contentp">
            The area that current A.I has probably least developed has been in recreation and entertainment. While there has been some exploration in letting algorithms generate art, write scripts and books, as well as creating music, many of these have proven to be very poor uses of the technology. </p>
            <div id="fillimage"><img class="contentimg" src="recreational1.JPG"></div>
            <p class="contentp">An argument can be made that current technology lacks the ‘human’ element necessary to entertain and genuinely interest, and that does apply to the aforementioned applications that researchers have tried. In order to understand and to produce culture, one must not only be able to understand it, but must also be able to experience it and be able to perceive what is enjoyable and what isn’t. Machine learning simply isn’t advanced enough for this, as it requires too much flexibility when it comes to data and thought, as well as emotional intelligence.
            <br>
            The artificial intelligence of today can work at the back end of recreation, such as managing seating for shows, designing parks and architecture, and handling the setup of entertainment options. A.I can pick and choose what shows and videos viewers might want to watch, which is a sign of emotional intelligence. However, neural networks are very limited in their understanding of why people prefer what they do; they can only make predictions off of what people have wanted in the past, and it’s clear that critical thinking isn’t how A.I goes about managing algorithms.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Uses</h2>
            <p class="contentp">One of the overarching goals in the development of A.I is to create something that is human, not just in ability to think, but also ability to feel, formulate opinions, and decisions that we can understand through the sheer relatability in the process through which they were formulated. Having a robot that could level with humans could potentially mean more than just having a technology that can outperform its creator; It could mean that we have new minds to think up art, music, and any form of entertainment. This is probably going to be one of the last areas for A.I to conquer, but that point may not be that far off.</p>
