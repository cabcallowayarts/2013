So now you have your domain name, your hosting service, and your FTP program. When you open up the FTP program, you'll notice something - you need a log-on! All of the information you need will be provided by your hosting service. Most times, a hosting service will have a dashboard associated with your account. Search for something along the lines of "FTP Information" here.
</p>
<p>
You'll need several things to log on. The hosting website will give more specific details.
	<ul>
		<li>Host: YOURdomainname.com</li>
		<li>Username: typically your username on the host website</li>
		<li>Password</li>
		<li>FTP Mode: passive</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Once you log on to your FTP program, it's simple! Drag your files from their location (i.e. Finder on a Mac) into the appropriate field in your program. Other programs, such as some that are Windows compatible, require a few extra steps when uploading. If you've uploaded a file before, you will be asked whether or not you wish to override existing files. If you want the old file to be replaced by the new, select "yes." When the transfer is complete, go to your website on the World Wide Web! Everyone has the ability to access it at this point. Be sure to check your uploaded site for errors that could have occurred during uploading or due to compatibility.

FTP programs don't read all file types. Some are the accepted are as follows: .htm, .html, .txt, .css, .js, .pdf, images (.gif, .jpg, .png), flash files (.swf), media files (.rm, .wma, .mp3, .flv).
