	<p>When a study of arts and academics are combined, each informs and enriches the other.

	<h3>Majors</h3>
	<p>Our students major in dance, digital media and communication arts, instrumental music, piano, strings, technical theatre, theatre arts, visual arts and vocal music. We celebrate a 100% graduation rate, with 98 â€“ 100% of our graduates attending post-secondary education each year. We believe that our students excel, not only because of their passion for the arts, but due to a commitment to their own education, the engagement of their parents and caregivers in the education of their children, and the dedication of the staff to create a learning environment that combines the arts and academics to motivate and inspire learning.<a href="http://www.cabcallowayschool.org/academics/departments/art-departments/" target="_blank"><h4>Click here to learn more</h4></a></p>

	<h3>Career Pathways</h3>
	<p>The core component of Cab Calloway's STEM career pathway is its Digital Media program. Digital Media combines the arts and techology to create a fully integrated program, which helps students get a head start in life. Digital Media encompasses a variety of subjects, from photography to web design, and from graphic design to cinematography.</p>

	<p>"Digital Media Majors encompass a wide variety of skills, everything from: creative writing, capturing images, designing logos, making layouts in print media, designing websites, and making cinematic works of art." - William Greider (Head of Digital Media)<a href="http://www.cabcallowaycommarts.org/" target="_blank"><h4>Click here to learn more</h4></a></p>

	<h3>STEM Curriculum</h3>
	<p>Cab Calloway School does not just specialize in the arts. In fact, it has some of the strongest STEM programs in the state of Delaware. Students are required to take a set amount of science credits, and then are allowed to extend their knowledge though AP classes. Cab students can also take classes at Charter School of Wilmington, which shares a building with Cab. Charter offers many more advanced science classes, such as Astronomy or Nanotechnology.</p>

	<p>Cab Calloway's Science Olympiad team is one of the top-ranking teams in the state. The Cab Calloway Math League team meets around once a week throughout the year, and participate in four meets, generally sending many people to states.
	Cab Calloway has had a lot of success over the past few years with Odyssey of the Mind. Many teams have ended up going to the world competition. These teams are formed by individuals, and then consult with a few teachers in order to get registered.<a href="http://www.cabcallowayschool.org/academics/departments/academic-departments/" target="_blank"><h4>Click here to learn more</h4></a></p>
