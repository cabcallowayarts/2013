Once you've made your website, you need a place to put it - a domain name. That's your "www.websitename.com." There are a lot of options out there. The three most common and obtainable types of domains are <b>.COM</b>, for commercial purposes, <b>.NET</b>, typically for internet-related companies, and <b>.ORG</b>, for organizations, often non-profits. Once you decide which ending best suits your needs, you have to decide on your domain's name! It should be something short and easy to remember. Too many extra characters makes it harder for internet users to find their way back to your website.
</p>
<p>
There are many places to purchase a domain name. One of the top rated companies is "GoDaddy.com", which is incredibly reliable and constantly running great promotions. Make sure beforehand that the website you buy from is trustworthy - great deals can come with poor service! When you've selected the company you're going to use, you'll be able to search their website to see which domain names are available - some are already in use! For instance, if I wanted to purchase "awesome.com", it may be taken, but "awesome.net" or "superawesome.com" may be available.

Next, you'll need to purchase a hosting service. These allow you to make your website accessible to the World Wide Web. Think of it like this: if buying a domain name is like buying a house, getting a hosting service is like buying land to put it on. It's easiest to buy hosting at the same place you get your domain name; working with two different companies requires you to transfer some information, and that can get messy. Check out your domain name seller's hosting packages before you buy anything. Later, you'll use the host information to upload your website to the web with a FTP program.
</p>
<p>
So now what? The next step is downloading an FTP program. FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. These programs transfer your website pages, images, and all accompanying files to a server. This allows the public to access your website - which is the whole purpose of making one in the first place. There are many free FTP programs out there available for download. The programs are specific to Macs and Windows computers, so be aware of what version you're installing.

Before you start getting your website up and running, you need to do some behind-the-scenes work: Organization. Uploading works best when all of your files are easy to find and easily read by the Internet.
</p>
<p>
Every web designer has their own way of doing things - you'll soon find yours too! The most popular method of organization, however, is separating HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, and images. In the main directory, place the HTML page files. Then, create folders for your CSS, JavaScript, and images. When uploading, things are easier to find and the URL links look cleaner on the web. If you haven't already organized your files and you move them, remember to update the links in your code! Moving files without changing their paths in your code can break links and mess up the look of your website!
