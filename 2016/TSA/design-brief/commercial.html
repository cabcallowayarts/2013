                <p>With evolving technology, we always hear about how machines are beginning to replace human jobs.  This could soon be true for the pizza delivery guy.  Drones have made their way into the delivery business.  Most notable is Amazon Prime, who plans to use drones for even faster and efficient delivery.  Food companies are also picking up the drone craze.  Domino's Pizza UK and California company Burrito Bombers both have showcased their drone designs for food delivery. </p>

                <p>Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, released his design of the "Octocopter", a drone which will deliver packages in 30 mins or less.  The technology, he says, will be available for commercial use in just 4-5 years. The new delivery system is called "Prime Air".</p>

                <p>Agriculture usually is associated with big bulky equipment, with few new sleek technological innovations. So drones don't really seem like they'd have a place, however, UAVs could soon be popping up in the farming industry as well.  Drones could be used for crop dusting, the monitoring of crops, or even irrigation.</p>

                    <h3><b>CASE STUDY:</b> ROBERT BLAIR</h3>
                </div>

                <p>Robert Blair, Idaho farmer, built his own drone to monitor his 1,500 acres of land.  He outfitted his drone with cameras and uses it to get a bird's eye view of his wheat, peas, barley and alfalfa fields. "It's a great tool to collect information to make better decisions, and we're just scratching the surface of what it can do for farmers."</p>

                <p>Drones have the ability to change the face of media as well.  Photography will be revolutionized with this new technology. Bird's eye view photography will be cheaper and more easily accessible, letting the creative focus on creating.  Facebook also jumped onto the UAV wagon. Their vision is to use drones to provide wireless internet in the remote parts of the world, and solar power drones can stay in flight for five years! News stations are also predicted to replace large expensive helicopters with drones.  Not only is this cheaper, but drones can fly lower, and get the shot that is needed.</p>

                <p>The James Bond Movie "Skyfall" pioneered in the field of drone cinematography.  The opening chase scene used drones to capture aerial shots of the buildings of Istanbul.  Other movies using drone cinematography include "Oblivion," "Man of Steel," "Star Trek: Into Darkness," "The Hunger Games," "The Dark Knight Rises," and "Iron Man 3."</p>

            <h2>PUBLIC SAFETY</h2>
            <div class="seperator"></div>

            <p>The use of commercial drones is coming, but there are many concerns over the safety and liability of this venture. Drones can be hazardous and unpredictable.  A majority of the concerns lie with the encounter between UAVs and planes. Over the last two years, 15  incidents have been reported, according to the FAA. Pilot Gregg Cromer explains that the course of a plane can be predictable, while the lightweight, sporadic moving drones can move in any direction at any time.  Drones also cause concern for those on the ground.  In the last five years, 236 "unsafe incidents" involving drones have been reported.</p>

            <div class="solution">

                <h3><b>SOLUTION:</b> COMMERCIAL DRONE LAWS</h3>

                <p>Since commercial drones and commercial drone accidents have started to rise in the past ten years, the FAA has started looking into possible ways to regulate these drones, making the skys safer for everyone. It has set many limitations on where people can fly their drones. Some of these include a 400ft height limit, a 5-mile no-fly radius around airports, and a ban from stadiums.</p>

                    <p>Fly4Me is one of over 500 commercially active drone companies.  Fly4Me, however, differs itself from the competition by offering their fleet of drones up for rent.  They are apart of an ever growing business venture known as drone service. Drone service is a rapidly growing business thanks to new government regulations which allow drones to be used for commercial use, as long as the provided gives explanations of what type of drones are being used, how they will be used, and why there is a need for “service” in the market place.</p>
                    <p>"We did not expect this kind of explosion, this kind of interest," says cofounder Dmitry Sharshunskiy. "We originally were going to launch only in Massachusetts, but we received so many requests that we had to immediately go nationwide."</p>
                    <p>More and more companies are jumping onto the drone service bandwagon.  A firm called Measure, although they currently have no drones in operations, is licensed to distribute over 400 types of drones!  This means, essentially, that any client can have instinct access to any type of drone.</p>
                    <p>A number of start-ups are still undiscovered, developing similar business models for drone service distribution.  The future of commercial drones is ever changing and will evolve further, with the development of new government regulations</p>

                    <p>What used to be seen as a rural, outdated, technologically illiterate job is now at the forefront of technology news.  UAVs are making their way into the agricultural spectrum.  Federal laws over the past few years have loosened their grip and permits are now being distributed to certain agricultural businessmen.  As the number of permit holders grow, the potential impact that drones have on the farming industry is huge.  Economically, billions of dollars could be saved and the job market could grow by the tens of thousands.   "The beauty of the whole thing is that it saves the farmer money and helps the environment, too," says Kevin Price, plant ecologist. </p>
                    <p>Many are asking how can drones improve the farming industry in such a drastic way?  The way drones will truly impact this industry is through a technique called NDVI, or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.  This is a measure of crop productivity, which is calculated on visible and infrared radiation.  Information can be picked up from an aerial view. This aerial view is captured using cameras on UAVs.</p>
                    <p>The future of agricultural drone usage can help improve our everyday lives.  Make our food healthier, our drinks tastier, and most importantly, produce a higher quality product. Drones have the ability to infiltrate every aspect of our lives, and agricultural advancements are just the beginning.</p>
