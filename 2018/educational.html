            <p class="contentp">The educational uses of artificial intelligence today aren’t extremely varied, however it can be very useful in education nonetheless. Most of the educational uses of artificial intelligence are to basically act as an advanced tutor or an assistant for teachers. This is referring to programs and things that will track progress of someone’s work, assess them, be constantly updating what they need to work on, and be gathering this type of information in mass and be changing its focuses depending on the person needs to work on. This can be useful because on things like a website platform, this type of A.I can help many people simultaneously, be it in one class or just in general. This an advantage to teachers because they can use these tools to get an effective baseline for their students and make more effective lesson plans by looking at the information that the A.I constantly gathers. A good example of this is the education website Khan Academy. It does all the aforementioned things and is used by many teachers nationwide. </p>

            <h2>Available Technologies</h2>
            <p class="contentp">
            In the case of our technology, a robot utilizing neural networks and machine learning has the ability to provide critical support to setting up curriculums, scheduling, and grading. While no software can reasonably be set up to perform a synthesis of these tasks, taken individually they are quite within the limits of what current A.I is capable of. A.I can also be utilized as a tool for setting up online courses, although communicating the content may have to be left to a human professor.
            <br>
            A robot could potentially be set up to be able to redesign the material to be covered in courses through automating the task of research into what knowledge is useful in the professions that a certain course is aimed at. Through machine learning, the robot could be fed information about professions and taught how to do background checks into requirements for those jobs by looking at the education of people who work those jobs. The robot could then narrow down what is useful and set up a list of subjects that need to be covered in a course, which would then be implemented through a human professor.
            </p>
            <p class="contentp">One of the most simple applications for an intelligent robot in education would be organizing schedules for students and teachers. On the most basic level, a robot could manage block rotations and save administrators from the grueling task of making sure that everyone can get to their selected classes. A potentially more challenging level would be the possibility of having A.I help students organize their daily schedules when it comes to schoolwork. The robot would have to consider what subjects take precedence over others, as well as the required amount of time for each task. However, given how far the limits of current technology have been pushed, an algorithm for personalized schedules could conceivably be set up.
            <br>
            Grading is also something with a wide range of potential difficulty. While techniques such as the use of scantrons have made some grading a very simple task, much of the process still lacks automation. For many subject areas, opinions and subjectivity are and essential part of what influences a grade, two things that technology today is incapable of achieving. However there are still things within the grasp of machine learning in the classroom that have yet to see A.I being implemented in them, such as correcting writing, handling stem subjects, or even analyzing basic statements to break down their meaning to increase the pace of grading.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Uses</h2>
            <p class="contentp">The desire for people developing A.I is that robots can continue to improve at communicating with and understanding the needs of students, which requires both scholarly and emotional intelligence. One day A.I may be able to serve as a teacher, first in writing, and then potentially later in speech and visuals. The requirements for being able to educate are varied, so innovations in A.I will create a strange spread of what a robot can be capable of for education in the future.</p>
