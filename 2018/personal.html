            <p class="contentp">The personal uses of artificial intelligence share the same purpose of a lot of machines today. This purpose is to make human life easier or more streamlined in some way. However, typical, non-intelligent machines can be very limited in tasks that call for human emotional or sensory intelligence. A.I on the other hand, can do more than a machine, and A.I has many different uses today. Software like Siri or Alexa use voice recognition A.I and carry out actions for us based off of what someone says. There are other forms of A.I that you might not notice, such as your recommended list on things like pandora and netflix, that all use A.I to generate and constantly update those lists. These A.I use machine learning to track and store data, as well as analyze it and “learn” from it and adjust accordingly. Machine learning is really shown in things like Nest. Nest is a thermostat that keeps track of you heating and cooling needs, and constantly adjusts the temperature in your house continuously throughout the day. All of these different applications of artificial intelligence are useful for anyone’s everyday lives, and prove the versatility of already existing A.I. technologies.</p>

            <h2>Available Technologies</h2>
            <p class="contentp">
            A surprisingly fleshed-out area of artificial intelligence is the area of personal uses, where it is being used to improve people’s lives and simplify tasks that might otherwise be very time-consuming efforts. Shopping, making calls, and time management have all been supplemented in some way by A.I, especially through in-home conversational devices. Tech companies like Amazon and Apple have been making strides towards digital personal assistants for years, and have been greeted by a fair amount of success. </p>
            <p class="contentp">In just about every area of life there has been some idea of how to use machine learning to streamline the process, and a lot has been acted on. Some areas are definitely staying away from the grasp of robots in the near future, however. Parenting, directly managing schedules, many cleaning and housekeeping tasks, and financial management all stay at least somewhat outside of the potential for automation.</p>
            <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
            <p class="contentp">Robots today still have the potential for error, which matters a lot when considering the important tasks that we already hand off to neural networks to accomplish. The opening market of self-driving cars is a minefield of ethical issues and debates for the people developing the technology. While it is true that self-driving cars have in some instances been proven to drive better than most humans, it is also true that automobiles may occasionally have to make choices that they don’t have the potential to handle effectively. For instance, if a car has to make a choice between hitting a tree or a person, there’s no way to determine for sure that it will attempt the less damaging option.</p>
            <h2>Future Uses</h2>
            <p class="contentp">A.I in the future will likely fill more and more roles in people’s daily lives, with the eventual goal being to develop a virtual assistant capable of all that a real assistant could accomplish for a person. Companies will continue to try to automate more and more parts of people’s lives, so it is an eventuality that much of what we do will in the future occur with the assistance of A.I.</p>
