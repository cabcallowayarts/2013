<p>What used to be Wilmington High School is now the arts school we know and love as Cab Calloway School of the Arts. Cab Calloway name came from a Jazz scat singer that became famous in the 1930's, offering superior education in the arts areas of: theatre, vocal music, visual arts, communication arts, technical theatre, strings, instrumental (band and piano), and dance in addition to regular academic classes. Cab Calloway School has been able to successfully combine the arts and academics for a well rounded, creative, and unique curriculum many schools don't offer. Being in this environment creates critically thinking and independent students. The school continues to celebrate art and creativity as Cab Calloway did throughout his lifetime through the school's performances, art galleries, plays, concerts, and more.</p>
<p>CCSA was established in fall of 1992 as a middle school, and in 1997 was expanded to a high school as well. The first senior class graduated in June of 2000. The school has recently participated in the Middle States program, is number two in the state, is the thirty-second magnet school in the nation, and is listed as a top high school nationally in the US News and World Report! This year the school is celebrating the schools 20th year of stellar arts and education.</p>
<p>Cab Calloway wanted to share his passion for the arts with everyone, and he loved the idea of being able to teach kids at a young age about these different art areas. Opening a school that embraces art and creativity was the perfect way to do so. A few Red Clay parents, teachers, and Cab's daughter Cabella Calloway (the board chairman) pitched the idea to the Delaware State Board of Education for a creative and performing arts middle school in Delaware in 1992. No one had anticipated for the school to work, but there was extra money, and Wilmington High School had their last graduating class in 1999, so the building was empty. There were no desks, there weren't even any books, so they built up the school from scratch.</p>
<p>To everyone's surprise, the school flourished. The school worked because it is based it upon the idea of young students being introduced to different forms of education, rather than standard paper and pencil methods. The school recognized that every child has a different learning style, and by linking it to academics, you can embrace their learning style, and they'll comprehend better. Discipline, creativity, enthusiasm, passion of the arts carries over to academics well, because you're used to reaching for perfection. Arts and academics fit hand in hand. A premier arts school was born, and the Board of Education asked if they could name the school after the iconic Cab Calloway himself. Cab was very excited about this. As Cabella said: "Most museums and monuments are dedicated to people who are dead, but he was still alive to actually see his legacy to go on."</p>
