	<p>
	If you go into the source of a webpage, you can almost always tell whether it was handwritten or generated by a program. The difference is messy code. Most web developers have developed an organization system that allows their code to be organized, and therefore easily read and edited.
	</p>
	<p>
	This is accomplished through the use of the 'tab' and 'enter' keys. When you are writing your code, it is smart to make a new line if you go to a new element, unless there is a specific reason you want it to be right next to it. Also, if you have an element within another element, it's a good idea to indent it, as it shows that it is contained.
	</p>
	<p>
	Another way to organize your code is through the use of comments. This is a special built-in feature of HTML that allows you to include text in the file without it being read by the browser. This means you can leave notes for yourself in the code, or even a secret message for those who know how to view the source code. This is accomplished through the following code:
	</p>
	<div id="code">
	&#60;!-- This is a comment that will not be read by the browser --&#62;
	</div>
	<p>
	Many developers use this feature, and it is especially useful on big projects, where you may forget what certain parts of your code do.
