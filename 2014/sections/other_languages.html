	<li><b id="header">Javascript</b>
    <ul>
    	<li><p>Javascript is not covered on this site, due to its complexity, but is very important to the web. Javascript is the way that people add interactivity to their sites. It is the web's official programming language, and it acts more like a normal programming language, as opposed to HTML or CSS (which are markup and styling languages). If you want to go full time making websites, it's best that you learn this. If that is the case, or if you're just curious, there are many good tutorials online. We will include one in the references.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
	<li><b id="header">PHP</b>
    <ul>
    	<li><p>If you were to go into the source code of a webpage, you would not find any PHP. Why is this? This is because PHP is a backend language. Instead of dealing with the webpage directly, inside of the browser, it works in the server that the website is hosted on. It is not really important when dealing with a basic website, such as a portfolio website, or buisness website. However, when you create a site that needs to interact with other sites, PHP becomes quite useful. PHP is one of many languages that works like this, and it is mentioned only because it is the most common.</p></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
	<li><b id="header">SQL</b>
    <ul>
    	<li><p>Going deeper into the web development world, we run into SQL. SQL is not technically a programming language, as it uses a completely different syntax, and is used for completely different purpose. SQL stands for structed query language, and is used to send and recieve information to and from servers. Like PHP, it is run server-side, and is never seen in the source code. It is also strange in the fact that it does not run on its own. It only runs within other languages, such as PHP, or in the command line.</p></li>
