    	<h2>The Dangers of Cell Phone Use</h2>
        <p> Because of the recent improvement among phones and smartphones, these devices have become deadly. Many laws have been made to stop people from using cellphones while driving. The government has also put up billboards and signs in public areas, to help the cause. There are also commercials to show the consequences of cellphone use while driving, so people will be more careful and aware of what could happen if they text and drive. In fact, 46 states have texting and driving laws, this also includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin islands, which shows that we are taking action to stop distracted driving and preventing crashes.</p>

    	<h2>Delaware's Distracted Driving Laws</h2>
        <p>Delaware prohibits all cell phone use while driving, in attempt to stop distracted driving. Although, in 2013, 5,057 crashes occurred in Delaware due to distracted driving. Delaware has laws to stop distracted driving, and cops to follow people that are on their phones to keep them from being distracted. Even with laws in place, people still text and drive. Delaware prohibits all cell phone use while driving, but people still do it in spite of the consequences.</p>

    	<h2>One More thing about Cell Phones</h2>
        <p>We all know we aren't supposed to use our cellphones when we drive, but some people still do, not realizing the seriousness of their actions. Texting while driving creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted. You wouldn't eat a restaurant that has 23 times the risk of you getting cancer. Then why do people drive with phones? We have to be more responsible when we drive. 3,328 people in 2012, died because they weren't being responsible while driving. It is the responsibility of all of us to be safe on the road and undistracted. It is our responsibility to reduce this number, together. </p>
