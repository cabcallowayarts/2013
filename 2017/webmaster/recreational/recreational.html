				<p>Augmented reality has opened up new doors to how people spend their free time by providing new sources of entertainment and possibilities for creativity and even exploring in some cases. AR increases engagement and interaction and provides a richer user experience. The light and sturdy hardware designs on the technology requiring more than an application download makes it just as easy and little interference. Smartphone applications are inexpensive.<br> </p>

				<h2>who's <em>watching?</em></h2>
				<div class="con-hr"></div>
				<p>Concerns in recreational uses arise in the question of privacy. Augmented reality records and analyzes data from the environment in real time. While the first amendment of the Constitution allows for recording for public interest, legal complications occur when recording outside the public domain or copyrighted media is displayed. <br> </p>
