            <p class="contentp">The most exciting territory for new A.I technologies is probably the commercial applications for intelligent machines. Today, throughout a slew of businesses and industries, the adoption and integration of machine learning to help speed up production and management is occurring at a rapid pace. A.I has been proposed as a solution to a limited workforce, as well as having the ability to eliminate the need to perform menial tasks such as sorting through files or moderating content. Many companies even use A.I to produce their main product, for example news publications that allow neural networks to mass produce articles for them. These, and other commercial uses of machine learning demonstrate the exciting future that A.I might also have ahead of it. Some economists believe that the ever-accelerating development of A.I can at some point lead to a commercial revolution, to a future where minimal human effort can allow the production of massive amounts of products, as a sort of continuation of the mechanization of factory jobs. While much of that is speculative, in the near future there are some certainties in how A.I will develop and expand in industry, which has both promise as well as anxieties attached to it.</p>
            <div id="fillimage"><img class="contentimg" src="commercial1.jpg"></div>
            <h2>Available Technologies</h2>
            <p class="contentp">
            The commercial world has been the quickest to adopt new A.I technologies into basic tasks and decision-making, with companies also being the origin of much of the development of machine learning in recent years. Three exciting places to look for A.I in industry would be in management, data-analysis, and eliminating office jobs.
            <br>
            One worldview-bending application of A.I has been in the realm of managing a business, from handling production to handling workers. Software today can navigate the way through the work of middle-management in companies, which mostly have to do with coordinating workers and overseeing the rate of work. This task is typically seen as a job that only humans should be able to, but development of A.I has been able to push boundaries into these areas.
            </p>
            <p class="contentp">Data analysis is a fairly complicated task in the scope of work, but new technologies have allowed robots to gain enough knowledge of some concepts to be able to analyze and act on data. One area that is particularly helpful to companies is the ability of A.I to handle data on customer response and the analysis of potential markets for products. Having the data put together allows for businesses to better know where, when and what to sell, which can seriously benefit profitability.
            <br>
            One fear about current technologies is that they may be capable of slashing away countless office jobs, which is certainly a possibility. Conversational A.I has gotten to the point where it may be able to replace jobs that have to do with handling calls and requests for customer support, which is an office job famous for its widespread need and boring nature. These and other common white collar jobs could see elimination through the use of A.I- All through currently available technology.
            </p>
            <h2>Future Uses</h2>
            <p class="contentp">A frightening prospect of A.I in the present and the near future is the potential for mass unemployment because of the ability of the technology to now fill so many more roles. This would pose an economic crisis where for the first time, the people in charge of corporations may not be dependent on the support of their workers to operate a successful business. Fears about this development actually creating a decline in quality of life may be justified, but at the same time there is doubt about the ability of A.I to replace more jobs that it may generate. </p>
