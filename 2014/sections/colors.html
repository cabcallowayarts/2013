<h2>Types of Color Schemes</h2>
<ul>
	<li><p>Monochromatic - using all of the shade and tints of a color</p></li>
    <li><p>Complementary - using colors on opposite ends of the color wheel <i>Ex: blue and orange</i></p></li>
    <li><p>Split Compliment - using the tertiary colors of the color wheel <i>Ex: blue and red and yellow</i></p></li>
    <li><p>Analogous - using colors that are next to each other and every color in between</p></li>
    <li><p>Cool - blue, purple, green</p></li>
    <li><p>Warm - red, orange, yellow</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Use Color Effectively</h2>
<p>
When designing a website, we want our content to be displayed in a easy to understand way that is visually pleasing.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
    <h2>Contrasting Colors Make Reading Easier</h2><br>
    <p>When using contrasting colors, such as white and black, it will be easier to read because the blacks will pop of the page. If we use color in the right ways, this will make our task a lot easier. Often dark text is used on a lighter background.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <h2>Use Color Sparingly</h2><br>
    <p>Color can help create interest in your website but too much can make your website look unorganized and scatter.  Keep you body and content plain colors and add color in your headers and important titles. When in doubt, stick to analogous, and monochromatic color schemes.</p>
    </li>

     <li>
    <h2>Do Not Use Complementary Colors</h2><br>
    <p>As stated before, complementary colors are colors on the opposite ends of a color wheel. When possible, do not use these colors side by side.  The colors contrast too much and create a hazing line between the two, which then creates headaches and difficulty reading.</p>
    </li>
