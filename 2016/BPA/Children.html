    <h1 class='head'> Your Child Could Mean Your Life</h1>
    <div class='mainnn'>
    	<p>You may think that your little angel is the most precious and harmless being in the world and the worst thing that she can do is throw a fit in the supermarket, but that is severely mistaken. Children can cause more than a little distraction in the car. From feeding them, playing the right music, making sure they are ready for school, keeping them out of fights, and making the kids happy. They all cause you to take your eyes off the road. "I'm a horrible offender," admits the Queen Creek, Arizona, mom, who spends two hours in the car each day, driving her kids, 5 and 7, to school. "I find myself driving with my knees while I hand out breakfast and drinks like a flight attendant. I referee arguments. Once, I even reached back to deflect a car sick kid's vomit out a window with a sun visor. The worst part is that I had a cousin who died in a car crash (she was trying to get something off the floor for her child), and it still hasn't stopped me from making these bad choices." Bad choices like these could lead to life changing events. </p>

		<p> There are some ways to prevent this though. Make sure you do your research, and buy a safe and reliable family car. You also should never leave your driveway without your kids buckled in. Taking that one step further, make sure your child has everything they need for the car ride. Get them a snack, and maybe something to keep them busy like a coloring book. And if you can't feed the kids before you leave, keep a snack bag close by. Experts say the first thing to do is set up car rules so your kids know what to expect. If they drop something, parents need to make sure they know the driver cannot pick it up until the car stops. Also, if you need to take your eyes off the road for your child, for any reason, pullover. You're better safe than sorry. </p>

		<p>You might think that this is people worrying over nothing, after all, you're a good driver, you have this under control, but the facts are scary. Every day, 7 children are killed and another 872 are injured in motor-vehicle collisions across the United States, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Not only that, Australian researchers found that the average parent takes their eyes off the road for a staggering three minutes and 22 seconds during a 16-minute trip. That is almost Â¼ of their car ride not looking at the wheel. This kind of driving can be extremely dangerous. What's even scarier is that this can be even more dangerous than cell phones. According to their findings, children are 12 times more distracting to the driver than talking on a cell phone while at the wheel. We all know not to use our cell phone while driving, so why don't we know the dangers that our children have while we drive. Furthermore, according to the AAA, babies are eight times more distracting to the driver than adult passengers. We have to be careful and aware when driving with children, we don't want to risk anyone's life.</p>
