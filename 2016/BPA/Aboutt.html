        <div class='main'>
            <p>Our web team is from Cab Calloway School of the Arts in Wilmington, Delaware from our Cab BPA chapter. The 2016 theme for web design is distracted driving, specifically on how passengers distract drivers. The 2016 BPA Slogan is "It's Our Time." We portray the theme of distracting passengers by focusing three different pages on different types of passengers. We integrated the "It's Our Time" slogan by creating a modern look for the website. Business Professionals of America has given us the wondrous opportunity to enhance our skills in not only web design but also teamwork, graphic design, creative writing, photography among many others. We can use the information we have learned to have a safer future and to do great things. </p>

            <h2>Web Design</h2>
            <p>Kristin Mikles is an 8th grade Drama major at Cab Calloway. She was in charge of web design and coding. She used HTML and CSS to create a fully functional website. To do this she used Adobe Dreamweaver. This caused some technical difficulties at some points but it was worth it to get the desired final product. Bootstrap was also used to give the website a clean, modern feel. Using bootstrap made it easier to code CSS, which can be a bit of a struggle at some points. This competition was helped improve her skills and become a better programmer. It's our time to take advantage of the skills we have and make something to be proud of. </p>

            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>Katherine is an eighth grade visual major at Cab Calloway School of the Arts. She was in charge of the writing and editing of the website. She made sure all of the sources we used were credible and relevant and all of the writing was spelled correctly and understandable. Though she found it hard to come to agreements with her teammates while editing their speeches, she and her teammates were able to come to compromises and create a speech they were all happy with. </p>

            <h2>Graphics</h2>
            <p>Meet our graphic designer, Shaana Singh. She is currently a seventh grader and attends Cab Calloway School of the Arts. Her major is visual arts, and she has several electives. The website's topic is distracted driving, and Shaana was asked to incorporate that and the causes in her graphics. She designed two graphics, one shows a car crash and the other is an illustration of one of the many causes of car crashes and distracted driving: food. Both graphics were created using Adobe Illustrator, a program artists and graphic designers use everyday. Her first graphic shows how severe being inattentive while driving a vehicle is. Everyone in the car is coincidentally all performing distracting tasks, which leads to the front of the car crashing into a huge garbage bin. The second graphic that Shaana created shows three foods that people usually focus on rather than keeping their eyes on the road while driving. A donut, pizza, and a cup coffee is shown. Shaana understands like many others that sometimes visual examples/illustrations and words are both needed help people to fully grasp a situation. Distracted driving is a serious issue, which is why Shaana, as a graphic designer, decided to show this in the best way she could. </p>

            <h2>Writing & Photography</h2>
            <p>Lauren Edmiston is an eighth grader at Cab Calloway School of the Arts. She took part in the website by writing and researching information. She researched facts about Distracted Driving and found sources for many different topics. She found credible sources that would go along with the information. She also took pictures for the website. At times, she found it hard to find time to do the work at home, with her many extracurricular activities outside of school, but she managed to make room for BPA. Along the way, she learned how to find credible sources, take good photos and how to manage her time.</p>
